## Summary():
### Summary function provides a concise statistical summary of numerical variables in a dataset. Here's what the summary() function typically represents and how it is used:
## Purpose of Summary() Function
### Statistical Summary:
#### For Numerical Variables: summary() computes summary statistics such as minimum, 1st quartile (Q1), median (Q2), mean, 3rd quartile (Q3), and maximum values for each numerical variable in the dataset. It also provides the number of non-missing values (NA counts are omitted) and the summary() function provides a quick statistical overview of numerical variables, making it a fundamental tool for initial data exploration, quality assessment, and understanding the characteristics of the dataset before proceeding with further analysis or modeling.

### Checking the unique values in Dataset for each variable :

### Counting the each unique values:

## Handling Missing values:
### The is.na() function returns a logical vector indicating TRUE for elements that are missing (NA) and FALSE otherwise.
### You can use this function to check for missing values in a dataset or a specific column. 
### As we got the the output of False means, this dataset doesn't contain any missing value, So if the output is True also we can handle missing value with mean() and median() for Numerical variables and mode() for Categorical variable

## Data Analysis:
#### Data analysis is a dynamic process that involves exploring, interpreting, and drawing insights from data to solve problems, make informed decisions.

### Correlation Analysis
#### The correlation matrix corr_matrix will be a square matrix where each cell represents the correlation coefficient between two variables. Hereâ€™s how to interpret it:
#### Values: Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1:
#### Positive Correlation: Close to +1 indicates a strong positive relationship (as one variable increases, the other tends to increase).
#### Negative Correlation: Close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship (as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease).
#### No Correlation: Close to 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.

## Data Visualization:
### Visualizing the mtcars dataset can provide insightful representations of the relationships between different car attributes.

### Detecting outliers in a dataset is essential for identifying data points that deviate significantly from the majority of observations. Several types of plots can help visualize and detect outliers effectively:
## Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)
### Box plots display the distribution of data: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. Outliers are typically identified as points beyond the whiskers (1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from Q1 and Q3).
### Box plots are useful for comparing distributions across categories or variables and visually identifying data points that lie outside the expected range. Here we don't have any Outliers.

## Scatter Plots
### Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. For example, you can examine how mpg (Miles per gallon) relates to hp (Horsepower) or wt (Weight of the car).
